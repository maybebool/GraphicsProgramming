## Low level Mesh creation with Silk.net

![Silk.NET](https://github.com/maybebool/GraphicsProgramming/blob/main/SAE.5300S1/Images/6.jpg)

In this project I created some Textures, Shaders and Meshes via Silk.net for different models. 
Each model represents a different type of material.

The main goal of this project is to create meshes with a low level approach. Meaning to create and control our own EBO, VBO and VAO.
