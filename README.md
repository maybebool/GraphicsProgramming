## Low level Mesh creation with Silk.net

![Silk.NET](https://github.com/maybebool/GraphicsProgramming/blob/main/SAE.5300S1/Images/6.jpg)

In this project, I used Silk.NET to create various textures, shaders, and meshes for different models, each representing a different type of material.

The main goal is to use a low-level approach when creating meshes, which means manually setting up and controlling our own EBO, VBO, and VAO.

### Settings
Press the Space bar to enter observation mode.

In observation mode, navigate using the W, A, S, and D keys while holding the left mouse button.

Press the Space bar again to exit observation mode and return to settings mode.
